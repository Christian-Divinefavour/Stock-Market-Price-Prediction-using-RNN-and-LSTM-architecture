# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction-using-RNN-and-LSTM-architecture


Accurately predicting the stock market has posed a major difficulty for traders and investors; amateurs and professionals alike. Various methods of analysis and indicators have been implored to predict stock prices but the untidiness of the stock market denies any distinct rule to estimate or predict these prices consistently. By incorporating Artificial Neural Network techniques, in this study, I attempt to develop a seemingly intelligent and autonomous system that could make future forecast for sequential data such as the stock market, almost precisely. Historical data of the Brent Oil Commodity (BRENT.CMD) is used as a case study and input data to build the Neural Network model. Customizable features and parameters for the model design are also outlined. Although, due to its complex domain, the stock market can never be consistently predicted, this project aims at applying machine learning in forecasting stock prices.


The results from my prediction is compared to the actual close prices of the later 5 days in the table below.

This program was written in Google Colaboratory and for certain issues and differences with Tensorfloe versions, Protobuf and Python. The BRENToil.csv was generated from https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/ The program tends to predict the future price of brent oil just for five trading days after DEC 2, 2010-SEP 2, 2019 . This is not a trading advice. It is just for educational purposes only.
